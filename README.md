Notifications
-------------

Budgie Desktop supports the freedesktop notifications specification, enabling applications to send visual alerts to the user. These notifications support actions, icons, as well as passive modes.

To ensure the user doesn't miss the notification, it's automatically archived into the Raven Notification view for quick and easy access.
