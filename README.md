budgie-desktop
==========

The Budgie Desktop is the flagship desktop of Solus OS.

NOTE:: The `master` branch is currently highly unstable, due to a rework.
For now use commit from before 0596e73177f74911eb93ccd6eca952c79b88f25f
or use the 10.2.2 tag, thanks!

Building
--------

budgie-desktop has a number of build dependencies that must be present
before attempting configuration. The names are different depending on
distribution, so the pkg-config names, and the names within the Solus
Operating System, are given:

    - gobject-2.0 >= 2.44.0
    - gio-2.0 >= 2.44.0
    - gtk+-3.0 >= 3.16.0
    - gio-unix-2.0 >= 2.44.0
    - uuid
    - libpeas-gtk-1.0 >= 1.8.0
    - libgnome-menu-3.0 >= 3.10.1
    - gobject-introspection-1.0 >= 1.44.0
    - libpulse >= 2
    - mutter >= 3.18.0
    - gnome-desktop-3.0 >= 3.18.0
    - libwnck >= 3.14.0
    - upower-glib >= 0.9.20
    - polkit-agent-1 >= 0.110
    - polkit-gobject-1 >= 0.110

And:

    - vala >= 0.28

To install these on Solus:

```bash

    sudo eopkg it glib2-devel libgtk-3-devel libpeas-devel gobject-introspection-devel util-linux-devel pulseaudio-devel libgnome-menus-devel libgnome-desktop-devel mutter-devel polkit-devel libwnck-devel upower-devel vala
    sudo eopkg it -c system.devel
```

Clone the repository:

```bash

    git clone https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop.git
```

Now build it:
```bash

    cd budgie-desktop
    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
    make -j$(($(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)+1))
    sudo make install
```

Theming
------

Please look at `./data/theme/sass` to override aspects of the default
theming. Budgie theming is created using SASS, and the CSS files shipped
are minified. Check out `./data/theme/README.md` for more information
on regenerating the theme from SASS.

Alternatively, you may invoke the panel with the GTK Inspector to
analyse the structure::

```bash

    budgie-panel --gtk-debug=interactive --replace
```

If you are validating changes from a git clone, then::

```bash

    ./panel/budgie-panel --gtk-debug=interactive --replace
```

Note that for local changes, GSettings schemas and applets are expected
to be installed first with `make install`.

Note that it is intentional for the toplevel `BudgiePanel` object to
be transparent, as it contains the `BudgieMainPanel` and `BudgieShadowBlock`
within a singular window.

Also note that by default Budgie overrides all theming with the stylesheet,
and in future we'll also make it possible for you to set a custom theme.
To do this, test your changes in tree first. When you have a reasonable
theme put together, please open an issue and we'll enable setting of
a custom theme (no point until they exist.)

Testing
------

As and when new features are implemented - it can be helpful to reset
the configuration to the defaults to ensure everything is still working
ok. To reset the entire configuration tree, issue::

```bash

    dconf reset -f /com/solus-project/budgie-panel/  
```

Porting
------

If using a tarball, note that the distributed tarball includes the generated
.c and .h files. This means any Vala conditionals are invalidated. To
combat this, simply issue the following before doing any configure::

```bash

    make maintainer-clean
```

This ensures all the autogenerated `*.{c,h}` files are cleaned, and conditionals
will work with your build.

Known Issues
-----------

Currently the GtkPopover can *randomly* glitch when the panel is at the
bottom of the screen. It is expected to be fixed in a later commit, however
let's be fair, it does kinda look better up top.

*Update*: This only happens on the *first* show of the applet.
