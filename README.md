NOTICE TO CONTRIBUTORS
-----------------------

Budgie is *NO LONGER* accepting any contributions that *ADD* Vala code to the
Budgie codebase. Please see [this bug](https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop/issues/501) for further details.

Reporting issues & Project Integration.[test]
---------------------------------------

If you are integrating Budgie into your project/distribution/whatever-it-is,
then we are happy to accept valid bug reports, so long as it does not corrupt
the distro-agnostic aims of Budgie.

Note that all projects and people are treated equally, every individual or
project's name involved in contributing to, or reporting bugs against Budgie,
carry precisely the same weight. There are no special exceptions.

Under **no circumstance** should you use GitHub generated tarballs to integrate
Budgie Desktop into your project/distro/whatever-it-is. These tarballs are not
correct, and are not supported by the maintainer.

If we determine your package uses GitHub generated tarballs, or bypasses our
own release and build processes, your bug will be invalidated and no support
will be received.

Note that a valid generated tarball for use from git can be generated and
hosted in your own infrastructure as follows:

    ./autogen.sh
    make distcheck

Note bleeding-git builds may lack translations, so `make dist` is permitted.
Build systems supporting building from specified git tags **must** use a recursive
clone, due to use of git submodules. Failure to do so invalidates the release
and build processes and will also invalidate your bug if this is discovered.

**Long Story Short:**

Don't make other users suffer because you failed to follow our established
build and release processes. Use standard methods, and we all benefit.

Please note that the **master** branch is the active development branch. Note that
`master` is ever-changing! This means if you provide some form of magical package
that builds directly from git master (which you should never do, there is no
form of reproducability) - bugs, features, dependencies and issues change
with *every build.* You also remove my freedom to break my own branch, so
please ensure you use specific *git shas* and test your packages, and then
update to the newest commit and freezing there.

To install these on Solus:

```bash

    sudo eopkg it glib2-devel libgtk-3-devel gtk-doc libpeas-devel gobject-introspection-devel util-linux-devel pulseaudio-devel libgnome-menus-devel libgnome-desktop-devel gnome-bluetooth-devel mutter-devel polkit-devel libwnck-devel upower-devel accountsservice-devel vala
    sudo eopkg it -c system.devel
```

Clone the repository:

```bash

    git clone https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop.git
```

Now build it:
```bash

    cd budgie-desktop
    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
    make -j$(($(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)+1))
    sudo make install
```

Theming
------

Please look at `./data/theme/sass` to override aspects of the default
theming. Budgie theming is created using SASS, and the CSS files shipped
are minified. Check out `./data/theme/README.md` for more information
on regenerating the theme from SASS.

Alternatively, you may invoke the panel with the GTK Inspector to
analyse the structure::

```bash

    budgie-panel --gtk-debug=interactive --replace
```

If you are validating changes from a git clone, then::

```bash

    ./panel/budgie-panel --gtk-debug=interactive --replace
```

Note that for local changes, GSettings schemas and applets are expected
to be installed first with `make install`.

Note that it is intentional for the toplevel `BudgiePanel` object to
be transparent, as it contains the `BudgieMainPanel` and `BudgieShadowBlock`
within a singular window.

Also note that by default Budgie overrides all theming with the stylesheet,
and in future we'll also make it possible for you to set a custom theme.
To do this, test your changes in tree first. When you have a reasonable
theme put together, please open an issue and we'll enable setting of
a custom theme (no point until they exist.)

Testing
------

As and when new features are implemented - it can be helpful to reset
the configuration to the defaults to ensure everything is still working
ok. To reset the entire configuration tree, issue::

```bash

    dconf reset -f /com/solus-project/budgie-panel/  
```

Distro Integration
------------------

In order to override the default panel layout, you should provide your own `panel.ini`
in the system-wide vendor directory: `$(datadir)/budgie-desktop/panel.ini`

Note that the system configuration directory is the domain of the system administrator,
and you should not ship a `panel.ini` in this location. This location is:

    $(sysconfdir)/budgie-desktop/panel.ini

This is to allow users to make global layout changes for all users on the system.
Please see `./data/panel.ini` for a reference.

To override the specific GSettings, you should implement gschema overrides. For an example
of this, please see https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop-branding


Known Issues
-----------

Currently the GtkPopover can *randomly* glitch when the panel is at the
bottom of the screen. It is expected to be fixed in a later commit, however
let's be fair, it does kinda look better up top.

*Update*: This only happens on the *first* show of the applet.
