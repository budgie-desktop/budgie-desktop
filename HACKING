Indentation is strictly 8 spaces (set tab stops to 8 spaces) - No tabs
No spaces between function name and parentheses. Only use space after
"if (", etc.

Curly braces must be on the same line (i.e. expressions) unless it
is the function declaration:

Acceptable:
        int main(int argc, char **argv)
        {
                if (someThingOrOther) {
                        // Do something
                }
                return 0;
        }

Unacceptable:
        int main(int argc, char **argv) {

                if(someThingOrOther)
                {
                        // Do something
                }
                return 0;
        }

When appropriate remember to declare your function first! It helps when
looking back through the file.

Use consistent pointers! "*" should prefix your variable name. Also ensure
your pointers (where appropriate) are not left uninitialized, resulting
in broken g_free() calls.

Acceptable:
        char **something = NULL;
        doFunc(&something);

Unacceptable:
        char** something;
        doFunc(&someThing);

Minimise your use of "goto"'s, and test every code path is reached. Also
ensure *every* if/else, etc, even if single line, is wrapped in curly braces.
